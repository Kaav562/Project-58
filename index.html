        <p>I like Iron Man because he is the most loved and he has a very large fan following. His name in the movie is Tony Stark his actor's name is Robert Downey Jr. I also like him because of his coolness in stressfull situations. He is very rich he has several houses and he has been in many movies like all of the avengers movies,Sherlock Holmes and Dolittle</p>
